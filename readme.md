# Project Name: Suggestions for Mood

Problem: 
Some feelings are positive. Think about happiness, joy, being in love, being curious,Â and being happy. These good feelings are nice. Negative emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or rejection can be hard and even painful. It takes time to learn how to notice and name your feelings. Even if you know how you feel right now. How do we handle this? This app will help you by recommending movies, music, or things to do based on how you're feeling at the moment. Simply, enter your current mood and let's explore the app suggestions.

# Requirements
To work on this project, you will need to know the basics of the following technologies and language:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): allows you to create great-looking web pages (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS)
DOM (The Document Object Model): is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP#:~:text=Hypertext%20Transfer%20Protocol%20(HTTP)%20is,be%20used%20for%20other%20purposes) 
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, or Ajax, is not a technology in itself, but rather an approach to using a number of existing technologies together, including HTML or XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, XML, XSLT, and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX)
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)
JS (JavaScript): is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

# Instalation Instructions
To work on this app, you need to follow these steps:
1. Instal Node.js and npm (the Node.js package manager) on your computer. You may download and install them from the official website (https://nodejs.org/) if you do not already have them.
2. Fork and clone the repository containing the code for the application to your computer. You may do this by entering git clone followed by the URL of the repository you want to clone in your terminal.
3. Open the project's root folder in the terminal and execute npm install to install all necessary files.
4. Start the JSON server, using the command npm run json:server. This will start the server and provide access to the db.json file's contents.
